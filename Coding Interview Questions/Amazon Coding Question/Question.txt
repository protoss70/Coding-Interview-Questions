Question:

There is a stair with n steps and a list of numbers x
Let’s say k = [1,3,5] this means we can step one by one, three by three and five by five (note: k can be anything).
Find the number of ways to reach to the top

For example: if k = 10
      1, 3, 3, 3
      3, 1, 3, 3
      And so on…
