# Coding Problems

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems I have tackled over the years. One of the most memorable problems I solved was an **Amazon Coding Question** during high school, which required deep thinking and persistence. It took me 2 months to develop a working solution.

## Highlight: Amazon Coding Question

### Problem:

You are climbing a staircase with `n` steps. You are allowed to take steps defined in a list `x` (e.g., `x = [1, 3, 5]`, meaning you can take 1-step, 3-step, or 5-step moves).  
The goal is to determine the total number of ways to reach the top of the staircase.

#### Example:
If the staircase has 10 steps (`n = 10`) and the allowed steps are `[1, 3, 5]`, you need to calculate all possible combinations of moves to reach the 10th step, such as:
- `1, 3, 3, 3`
- `3, 1, 3, 3`
- And many more.

### Video Explanation

I have created a detailed explanation video of how I solved this problem. The video is in Turkish as I was in high school:
